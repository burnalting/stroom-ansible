# NOTES:
# From the portal copy the 'Login Command' and run this in the shell.
# This will create ~/.aws/credentials
# Run export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=<YOUR PROFILE NAME>, where the profile name is taken from
# the header in the credentials file
# Copy the values in the credentials file to aws_keys.yml
# Consider using this to saving having to add hosts to the inventory
