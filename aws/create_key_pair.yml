# Creates the ec2 Key Pair and downloads the cert to ~/.ssh.
#
# You can only download the cert for the key pair when you
# first create the key pair. So if you don't have the cert
# then you need to create a new key pair.
#
# This playbook will attempt to use your machines hostname
# as the name for the key pair and for the cert file in ~/.ssh.
#
# This will fail if you already have a cert in ~/.ssh. If
# that happens then run remove_key_pair.yml.
